# EXPERIMENT 3: C++ Decision Making Statements

## Aim
- To study and implement decision making statements in C++.
- To understand the use of conditional logic to control program flow.

## Apparatus
- Programiz Online Compiler or Visual Studio (VS)

## Theory

### Decision Making in C++
Decision making statements allow a program to take different actions based on certain conditions. These are essential for writing programs that respond dynamically to different inputs or situations.

C++ provides the following decision making statements:
- `if` statement
- `if...else` statement
- `nested if` statements
- `else if` ladder
- `switch` statement

These statements evaluate conditions and execute different blocks of code depending on whether the condition is true or false.

## Functions

- Implement conditional logic using `if`, `if...else`, and `switch` statements.
- Accept input from the user and apply decision making based on values.
- Use comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) to test conditions.
- Understand how branching works to control the flow of a program.

## Conclusion
Through this lab, I learned how to use decision making statements in C++ to control program behavior based on conditions. I practiced writing programs using `if`, `else`, and `switch` constructs, which helped me understand how logical conditions influence program flow. This experiment enhanced my ability to write interactive and flexible programs.
